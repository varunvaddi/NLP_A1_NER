    "Summary:\n",
    "- Precision and recall are relatively low, indicating that spaCy's NER model is making significant number of False Positives and False Negative predictions compared to manual NER.\n",
    "- The number of false positives is slightly higher than false negatives, which implies that SpaCy is more likely to incorrectly identify entities that do not exist than to miss out on existing ones\n",
    "- The relatively low F1-score reinforces that the performance of SpaCy's NER in this case is suboptimal, and there's room for improvement. "
